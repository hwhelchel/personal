# Harry Whelchel

I help businesses grow through sales strategy and marketing that actually works.

Over the past 12 years, I've worked with everyone from Fortune 500 brands to bootstrapped startups, learning what drives real results. I've generated over $1.1M in revenue for my own businesses, managed $500K in ad spend across multiple channels, and helped 400+ clients improve their sales and marketing.

Right now, I'm building **Sing with the Stars**—an interactive Broadway experience where audiences sing alongside performers from shows like Hamilton, Wicked, and The Book of Mormon. It's been a fun challenge applying marketing principles to live entertainment, and we've built a 4.7/5 rating from 200+ guests so far.

## What I Do

I focus on the stuff that moves the needle: sales strategy, marketing campaigns that convert, and helping businesses scale without burning through cash.

**Sales Strategy & Training** - Most businesses have a sales problem, not a marketing problem. They're getting leads but not closing them, or their sales team isn't performing. I help build sales processes that actually work and train teams to execute them. I've developed a 32-hour sales training program, taught 400+ people to sell, and helped clients generate $90K in a single month. The key is focusing on relationships, not transactions, and giving people a framework they can actually use.

**Marketing Consulting & Campaign Management** - I help businesses figure out what marketing actually works for them—not what the latest blog post says, but what drives real results. That usually means running campaigns across multiple channels, testing what works, and scaling what converts. At Teleport, I managed campaigns across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat simultaneously, getting cost per acquisition down to $3. The secret? Testing hundreds of creatives and finding what resonates with your specific audience.

**Conversion Rate Optimization** - Most businesses are leaving money on the table because their conversion rates are too low. I help identify what's broken, test fixes, and optimize for better results. At Teleport, we got mobile app installs down to $3 CPA through relentless testing and optimization.

**Growth Marketing** - I help businesses scale efficiently—growing revenue without burning through cash on ads that don't work. This usually means building systems that can scale, not just running one-off campaigns. I've scaled businesses from startup to $1M+ revenue and generated $1.1M in revenue over three years with Unstarving Artists.

**Online Advertising** - I manage ad campaigns across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat. I've spent $500K on advertising and learned what actually works—which is usually different from what the platforms tell you. The platforms I work with include Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, X (Twitter), Snapchat, and tools like Arcads for creative production.

**Lead Generation** - I help businesses generate leads that actually convert. I've generated leads for 70+ clients across tech startups, solopreneurs, and B2B companies. The key is understanding your audience and reaching them where they actually are.

**Pricing Strategy** - Pricing is often the fastest way to increase revenue, but most businesses don't think about it strategically. I help optimize pricing models to maximize revenue without losing customers. I've helped clients optimize their pricing, and it's contributed significantly to revenue growth—including my $90K best month in consulting.

## How I Work

I focus on results, not theory. Every engagement starts with understanding your business, then we test what works, scale what converts, and build systems that can grow with you. I work through consulting engagements, training programs, campaign management, speaking engagements, and retainer relationships—whatever makes sense for your situation.

## Recent Work

**Unstarving Artists** - Built a sales training business from scratch, working with 400+ visual artists over three years. Spent $500K on advertising, generated $1.1M in revenue, and sold it on Acquire.com. The whole thing taught me a lot about niche markets and building scalable training programs.

**Teleport** - As Head of Brand Communications, I ran the marketing for their Austin launch. Got cost per acquisition down to $3 by testing hundreds of video creatives across five platforms simultaneously. Also led a guerrilla marketing campaign at Consensus 2024 that drove hundreds of completed rides.

**Sing with the Stars** - Currently growing an interactive Broadway experience in NYC. It's been interesting applying B2B marketing principles to live entertainment—building community, creating memorable experiences, and driving word-of-mouth growth.

## Who I Work With

I've worked with tech startups, SaaS companies, e-commerce brands, professional services firms, healthcare companies, creative industries, and now entertainment businesses. The common thread? They all needed to grow revenue and scale efficiently.
