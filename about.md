I've spent the last 12 years figuring out what actually works in sales and marketing—not the theory, but the stuff that moves the needle in real businesses.

## How I Got Here

I studied Economics and Religious Studies at the University of Virginia. It's an odd combination, but it ended up being perfect for sales and marketing. Economics taught me to think in data and market dynamics—useful for pricing strategy and performance marketing. Religious Studies taught me to understand different perspectives and build relationships—essential for sales and creating marketing that resonates with diverse audiences.

During college, I discovered Paul Graham's essays and got interested in startups. That led to an internship at Cardagin Networks, a mobile loyalty startup, where I created drip email campaigns for client onboarding—my first real marketing experience. I also co-founded Crowdsurf, an app that let people control music in public spaces. Got 20,000+ downloads, won 3rd place in the UVa Cup, and learned a lot about product marketing and user acquisition.

After college, I went to Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco, learned Ruby on Rails, and worked as a software engineer at companies like SalesLoft and Manheim. At SalesLoft, I was the first junior engineer. I built reporting dashboards, email template systems, and real-time Salesforce integrations. That experience gave me insight into B2B SaaS marketing and how product features drive growth.

I also built a couple SaaS products: ChirpyHire for recruiting CNAs (sold it after serving 30+ clients) and StudioBridge for music studios. Building products taught me how to market them—understanding how they work makes it easier to explain why people should care.

But I realized I wanted to get better at the business side—specifically sales and marketing. So I started consulting, first for tech startups in Atlanta, then pivoted to working with solopreneurs during the pandemic.

That's when I noticed something interesting: a lot of my successful clients were visual artists. They were talented creators who struggled to sell their work. So I launched Unstarving Artists to teach them sales and marketing. Over three years, I worked with 400+ artists, developed a 32-hour training program, spent $500K on advertising, and generated $1.1M in revenue. Eventually sold it on Acquire.com.

The whole experience taught me that most people can sell—they just need the right framework and some confidence. It also showed me how to build scalable training programs and run effective ad campaigns. My best month was $90K in sales, and a lot of that came from helping clients price their services correctly.

After that, I joined Teleport as Head of Brand Communications. I ran their marketing for the Austin launch, getting cost per acquisition down to $3 by testing hundreds of video creatives across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat simultaneously. I used AI tools like Arcads to produce and test creatives at scale, tailored specifically to the Austin market. The key was testing relentlessly and finding what actually resonated. I also led a guerrilla marketing campaign at Consensus 2024 that drove hundreds of completed rides. Sometimes the best marketing isn't paid ads—it's creating experiences people remember.

Now I'm building Sing with the Stars, an interactive Broadway experience in NYC. It's been interesting applying B2B marketing principles to live entertainment—building community, creating memorable experiences, and driving word-of-mouth growth. We've got a 4.7/5 rating from 200+ guests so far. The biggest challenge has been figuring out how to market live events. You can't A/B test a show, but you can build a community around it and create experiences people want to talk about.

## What I've Learned

**Sales isn't about being pushy**—it's about understanding what people need and helping them get it. I've taught hundreds of people to sell, and the ones who succeed are the ones who focus on relationships, not transactions.

**Marketing works when you test relentlessly**—I've managed $500K in ad spend, and the campaigns that work are always the ones where we tested dozens of variations. At Teleport, we produced hundreds of video creatives using AI tools like Arcads, tailored specifically to the Austin market. That's how we got to $3 CPA.

**Pricing matters more than people think**—I've helped clients optimize their pricing, and it's often the fastest way to increase revenue. My best month in consulting was $90K in sales, and a lot of that came from helping clients price their services correctly.

**Technical skills help with marketing**—My background in software engineering gives me a different perspective on marketing tech companies. I understand how products work, which makes it easier to market them. I can read code, understand how SaaS products function, and explain technical features in ways that make sense to customers.

**Education shaped my approach**—The combination of Economics (analytical thinking, market dynamics), Religious Studies (understanding diverse perspectives, relationship building), and technical training (understanding how products work) creates a pretty useful foundation for sales and marketing. Most of what I know about sales and marketing, I learned by doing—running campaigns, seeing what works, staying curious, and testing things constantly.

## What I Do Now

I help businesses grow through sales strategy and marketing that converts. Most of my clients are in tech, SaaS, or professional services, though I've worked across plenty of industries.

I'm based in New York and available for consulting, speaking engagements, and the occasional marketing campaign. If you're looking to improve your sales process or launch campaigns that actually work, [let's talk](/contact/).
