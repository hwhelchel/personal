I've spent the last 12 years figuring out what actually works in sales and marketing—not the theory, but the stuff that moves the needle in real businesses.

## How I Got Here

I started in paid search at RKG, managing campaigns for Fortune 500 brands like Bed Bath & Beyond. That's where I learned to think in data and optimization.

After going to coding bootcamp and working as a software engineer at SalesLoft, I realized I wanted to focus on the business side—specifically sales and marketing. I started consulting for tech startups, then pivoted to working with solopreneurs during the pandemic.

That's when I noticed something interesting: a lot of my successful clients were visual artists who struggled to sell their work. So I launched Unstarving Artists to teach them sales and marketing. Over three years, I worked with 400+ artists, developed a 32-hour training program, spent $500K on advertising, and generated $1.1M in revenue before selling the business.

After that, I joined Teleport as Head of Brand Communications. I ran their marketing for the Austin launch, getting cost per acquisition down to $3 by testing hundreds of video creatives across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat simultaneously. I also led a guerrilla marketing campaign at Consensus 2024 that drove hundreds of completed rides.

Now I'm building Sing with the Stars, an interactive Broadway experience in NYC. It's been interesting applying B2B marketing principles to live entertainment—building community, creating memorable experiences, and driving word-of-mouth growth. We've got a 4.7/5 rating from 200+ guests so far.

## What I've Learned

**Sales is about relationships, not transactions**—I've taught hundreds of people to sell, and the ones who succeed focus on understanding what people need and helping them get it.

**Marketing works when you test relentlessly**—I've managed $500K in ad spend, and the campaigns that work are always the ones where we tested dozens of variations. At Teleport, we produced hundreds of video creatives to find what resonated.

**Pricing is often the fastest way to increase revenue**—I've helped clients optimize their pricing, and it's contributed significantly to growth. My best month in consulting was $90K in sales.

**Technical skills help with marketing**—My background in software engineering gives me a different perspective on marketing tech companies. I understand how products work, which makes it easier to market them.
