## LinkedIn

**[linkedin.com/in/harrywhelchel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrywhelchel)**

Feel free to connect on LinkedIn. I'm more active there than other social platforms.

## What I Help With

I work with businesses on:

- **Sales Strategy & Training** - Building sales processes that work and training teams to execute them
- **Marketing Campaigns** - Running campaigns across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat that actually convert
- **CRO** - Optimizing conversion rates and reducing customer acquisition costs
- **Growth Marketing** - Scaling businesses efficiently without burning through cash
- **Pricing Strategy** - Optimizing pricing to maximize revenue
- **Speaking** - I speak on sales, marketing, and entrepreneurship topics

I've worked with tech startups, SaaS companies, e-commerce brands, professional services firms, healthcare companies, creative industries, and entertainment businesses. If you're trying to grow revenue and scale efficiently, we might be a good fit.

## What to Expect

I typically respond within 24-48 hours. If you're reaching out about consulting, I'll want to understand your business, what you're trying to achieve, and whether I can actually help. I'm pretty direct about whether something is a good fit or not—saves everyone time.
