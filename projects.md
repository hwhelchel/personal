Here are some projects I've worked on and what I learned from them:

## Sing with the Stars (2025 - Present)

**The Challenge:** Launching a new interactive Broadway experience in New York City meant building an audience and community from the ground up in a highly competitive entertainment landscape.

**My Approach:** I've focused on creating memorable experiences that drive word-of-mouth growth. We've built a community of music lovers and Broadway fans, featured performers from popular shows like Hamilton, Wicked, and The Book of Mormon, and created a supportive environment that encourages repeat attendance.

The biggest difference from B2B marketing? You can't A/B test a show. But you can build a community around it and create experiences people want to talk about. Event marketing is all about the experience, not just the promotion.

**The Results:**
- **4.7/5 rating** from 200+ happy guests
- Built an engaged community of music lovers and Broadway fans
- Successfully launched and grew a unique entertainment experience in NYC

**My Takeaway:** In entertainment, the product *is* the marketing. Creating an exceptional, shareable experience is the most powerful way to build an audience and drive growth.

## Teleport (2023 - 2024)

**The Challenge:** Teleport needed to launch its service in Austin with a limited budget, demanding highly efficient customer acquisition and exceptional cost-per-acquisition (CPA) metrics.

**My Approach:** As Head of Brand Communications, I orchestrated a multi-channel marketing blitz. I scaled ad spend across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat simultaneously. To maximize impact, I used AI tools like Arcads to rapidly script, produce, and test hundreds of short-form video creatives, all meticulously tailored to the Austin market.

Beyond paid ads, I also led a guerrilla marketing campaign at Consensus 2024, which generated significant buzz and hundreds of completed rides.

**The Results:**
- Achieved an exceptional **$3 cost per acquisition** for mobile app installs
- Generated **hundreds of app installs** and **hundreds of completed rides** from the guerrilla campaign
- Successfully launched Teleport in a new, competitive market

**My Takeaway:** Relentless testing and market-specific creative are non-negotiable for efficient multi-channel advertising. And sometimes, a clever guerrilla campaign can amplify your paid efforts dramatically.

## Unstarving Artists (2021 - 2024)

**The Challenge:** Many talented visual artists struggle to make a living because they lack the skills to sell their work. They often see "selling" as a negative, which holds them back from building sustainable careers.

**My Approach:** I launched Unstarving Artists to bridge this gap. I developed a comprehensive 32-hour training program focused on relationship-based sales, ethical pricing strategies, and social selling. The goal was to empower artists to sell confidently without feeling "salesy."

To reach these artists, I invested **$500K in targeted advertising** across various channels. The key was speaking directly to their unique challenges and aspirations, showing them that selling could be an extension of their creative passion. I also fostered a supportive community where artists could learn and grow together.

**The Results:**
- **Served over 400 artists** in three years
- Generated **$1.1M in revenue** in the last two years of operation
- Successfully sold the business on Acquire.com

**My Takeaway:** Specialized training programs can scale incredibly well when you understand your niche deeply and build a supportive community around it. It's not just about the information; it's about the transformation.

## Sales Consulting Practice (2019 - 2021)

**The Challenge:** Helping bootstrapped solopreneurs and small businesses improve their sales and marketing without the luxury of large budgets.

**My Approach:** I built a consulting practice focused on practical, results-driven strategies. I started by generating leads for tech startups, then pivoted to solopreneurs, identifying an underserved market. My services included pricing strategy, lead generation, and sales training, all designed to deliver measurable impact quickly.

**The Results:**
- Onboarded **over 70 clients** during the pandemic
- Achieved a **best month of $90,000 in sales with $45,000 cash collected**
- Consistently delivered significant improvements in clients' sales performance

**My Takeaway:** Consulting can scale rapidly when you have proven methodologies and a clear understanding of your target market's needs. Focusing on tangible results builds trust and a strong referral network.

## ChirpyHire (2014 - 2019)

**The Challenge:** Marketing a new SaaS platform for recruiting Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) to healthcare facilities with a limited marketing budget.

**My Approach:** I focused on product-led growth, building features like automated SMS screening that immediately demonstrated value. My marketing efforts were highly targeted at healthcare facilities that desperately needed efficient CNA recruitment solutions. Customer success was paramount to drive referrals and retention.

**The Results:**
- **Served over 30 clients** before a successful exit
- Successfully sold the business to a team of engineers in Seattle

**My Takeaway:** For SaaS, the product itself is a powerful marketing tool. When your product solves a clear problem and delivers immediate value, customer acquisition becomes much more efficient.

## RKG | Rimm-Kaufman Group (2012 - 2014)

**The Challenge:** Managing paid search campaigns for Fortune 500 brands at scale, where advanced technology enabled analysts to handle thousands of ad sets across multiple client accounts simultaneously.

**My Approach:** I joined RKG as ecommerce companies began shifting budgets from traditional advertising to digital performance-based marketing. I led campaigns for Bed Bath & Beyond and Steves Blinds & Wallpaper, learning SQL, direct response marketing, and account management. I also restructured struggling accounts, focusing on data-driven optimization and performance improvement.

**The Results:**
- Successfully managed paid search campaigns for **Fortune 500 brands**
- Delivered **significant improvements in performance** for restructured accounts
- Improved **client retention** through better account management
- Gained expertise in SQL, direct response marketing, and large-scale campaign management

**My Takeaway:** Data-driven marketing at scale requires both technical skills and strategic thinking. Managing thousands of ad sets taught me how to identify patterns, optimize systematically, and deliver measurable results for enterprise clients. This foundation in performance marketing and account management became essential for everything that followed.
