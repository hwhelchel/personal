Here are some projects I've worked on and what I learned from them:

## Unstarving Artists

I noticed something interesting while consulting: a lot of my successful clients were visual artists. They were talented creators who struggled to sell their work. So I launched Unstarving Artists to teach them sales and marketing.

The challenge was that most artists think selling is "selling out." But the reality is, if you can't sell your work, you can't make a living as an artist. I developed a 32-hour training program that focused on relationship-based sales, pricing strategy, and social selling—basically teaching artists to sell without feeling like they're being pushy.

I spent $500K on advertising across multiple channels, targeting visual artists who wanted to build profitable art businesses. The key was finding the right niche and speaking their language. Over three years, I worked with 400+ artists and generated $1.1M in revenue. Eventually sold the business on Acquire.com.

The biggest lesson? Specialized training programs can scale if you find the right niche and build a community around them. Most artists didn't just need sales training—they needed to see other artists succeeding at it.

## Teleport

I joined Teleport as Head of Brand Communications to launch them in Austin. The challenge was getting efficient customer acquisition with a limited budget. We needed to make every dollar count.

I ran campaigns across Google, Facebook, TikTok, X, and Snapchat simultaneously. The key was testing hundreds of video creatives using AI tools like Arcads, all tailored specifically to the Austin market. We got cost per acquisition down to $3 for mobile app installs—which is pretty exceptional for mobile apps.

I also led a guerrilla marketing campaign at Consensus 2024 that drove hundreds of completed rides. Sometimes the best marketing isn't paid ads—it's creating experiences people remember and talk about.

The lesson here: Multi-channel campaigns work when you test relentlessly and tailor everything to your specific market. Generic creatives don't convert. Market-specific ones do.

## Sing with the Stars

Right now I'm building Sing with the Stars, an interactive Broadway experience in NYC. The challenge was launching in a competitive market and building an audience from scratch.

I've focused on creating memorable experiences that drive word-of-mouth growth. We've built a community of music lovers and Broadway fans, featured performers from popular shows, and created a supportive environment that encourages repeat attendance. We've got a 4.7/5 rating from 200+ guests so far.

The biggest difference from B2B marketing? You can't A/B test a show. But you can build a community around it and create experiences people want to talk about. Event marketing is all about the experience, not just the promotion.

## Sales Consulting Practice

During the pandemic, I pivoted from working with tech startups to consulting for bootstrapped solopreneurs. The challenge was helping people improve sales and marketing without large budgets.

I generated leads for Atlanta-based tech startups first, then realized there was a bigger opportunity with solopreneurs—career coaches, marketing consultants, dating coaches. During the pandemic, I onboarded 70+ clients. My best month was $90K in sales with $45K cash collected.

The key was finding underserved markets and delivering results quickly. I focused on pricing strategy, lead generation, and sales training—the stuff that moves the needle fast. The lesson? Consulting businesses can scale quickly if you find the right niche and deliver measurable results.

## ChirpyHire

I built ChirpyHire, a SaaS platform for recruiting CNAs. The challenge was marketing a new product to healthcare facilities with a limited budget.

I focused on product-led growth—building features (like automated SMS screening) that demonstrated value immediately. I targeted healthcare facilities specifically, not trying to be everything to everyone. Served 30+ clients before selling it to a team of engineers in Seattle.

The lesson: SaaS marketing works best when you focus on product value and customer success. Targeted marketing to specific verticals beats trying to appeal to everyone.

## Crowdsurf

During college at UVA, I co-founded Crowdsurf, an app that let people control music in public spaces. The challenge was launching a consumer app in a competitive space with minimal budget.

We focused on user experience and word-of-mouth growth. Secured partnerships with local venues to demo the app, optimized for the App Store, and got 20,000+ downloads. Won 3rd place in the UVa Cup, which gave us $8K in funding and some credibility.

The lesson: Consumer apps need great UX and word-of-mouth to grow. Partnership marketing can be more effective than paid ads when you're starting out.

## What These Projects Taught Me

**Find your niche** - Specialized markets often convert better than trying to appeal to everyone. Unstarving Artists worked because I focused on visual artists specifically.

**Test relentlessly** - The campaigns that work are always the ones where we tested dozens of variations. At Teleport, we produced hundreds of creatives to find what resonated.

**Build community** - Whether it's artists learning to sell or Broadway fans at a show, community drives growth. People want to be part of something.

**Focus on experience** - Especially for events and consumer products, the experience matters more than the promotion. Create something people want to talk about.

**Product value first** - For SaaS products, the product needs to demonstrate value immediately. Marketing can't fix a bad product.
